## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

## PID Implementation

### Proportional term, Integral term, Derivative term
1. Proportional term : Term to move to the center
	-> Controls in proportion to the size of the error value in the current state.
2. Integral term : Term to move smoothly to the center
	-> acts to eliminate steady-state errors.
3. Derivative term : Term that gives penalty to steering angle by accumulating errors to solve wheel angle errors
	-> Braking is applied to sudden changes in the output value to reduce overshoot and improve stability.

### parameters setting
1. P = 0.2 
2. I = 3.0
3. D = 0.004
I tested it while executing the project based on the value used in the udacity class, and it was confirmed that it works normally.
